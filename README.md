# Autonomous Racecar Human-Machine Interface

## Overview

This project is meant to serve as a human-machine interface (HMI) to be used for control and monitoring of an autonomous racecar.

### Abstract

Autonomous vehicle interfaces are increasingly necessary as the growing field of self-driving cars rapidly advances, so does the need for human-machine interfaces (HMI) which are imperative for safe and efficient deployment. This paper investigates the vital role of HMIs in operating autonomous vehicles safely and presents a novel HMI design for enhancing user interaction and vehicle control. Research indicates that a well-designed HMI serves as a critical link between the vehicle's autonomous capabilities and the human operator, ensuring effective communication, trust, and situational awareness. Our HMI allows for monitoring of vehicle information such as speed, temperature, tire pressure, flag rules, as well as attack and defend modes during racing events. By presenting intuitive and context-sensitive information, our HMI strives to minimize cognitive load and optimize decision-making, enabling human operators to maintain control and intervene when necessary, especially in complex and unexpected scenarios. Our research and development of race-car HMIs establishes a strong case for the significance of HMIs in the safe operation of autonomous vehicles on and off the race-track. By emphasizing the importance of effective communication, situational awareness, and operator intervention, our developed HMI contributes to the advancement of autonomous vehicle technology, paving the way for a future where humans and machines collaborate seamlessly to ensure safer transportation systems.
